# Teaching 

## Philosophy
<div style="font-size:16px;">
I believe in teaching economics as a foundation for critical thinking, where models serve as tools to structure thought and spark inquiry, highlighting channels for empirical exploration, rather than as objects of reverence. I offer strong support to struggling students, understanding firsthand the transformative impact of an inspiring teacher. My goal is to instill a genuine motivation for economics, emphasizing the essential complement between theory and evidence in meaningful investigation.
</div>

## Experience
<div style="font-size:16px;">
I have extensive teaching experience across a broad range of undergraduate and graduate courses in the College of Business and Economics (CBE) and the College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS) at the Australian National University (ANU). Starting as a Teaching Assistant in 2018, I was appointed as an Associate Lecturer at the Research School of Economics in 2022-2023. Currently, I serve as a Head Teaching Assistant. Throughout my teaching career, I have consistently received high student evaluations, with SELT scores exceeding 4.5/5.

## Other Responsibilities
<div style="font-size:16px;">
My teaching experience extends beyond the classroom, encompassing full course coordination and effective team management. In my roles as Associate Lecturer and Head Teaching Assistant, I organized course structures, coordinated and supported tutors, and liaised between the teaching team and students to ensure a smooth learning experience. I also handled sensitive academic cases that required balancing academic integrity, ethical standards, and empathy toward students’ unique situations—a role that often felt like walking on eggshells. Through these experiences, I have developed strong interpersonal skills and a commitment to creating a positive learning environment.

My responsibilities in various roles have included:

<div style="margin-top: 5px;"></div>

- Preparation and delivery of tutorials, lectures, workshops, and seminars
- Coordination and support of sessional tutors
- Involvement in professional activities related to the teaching field
- Student consultations
- Assessment and grading
- Development of course materials in collaboration with course coordinators
- Administrative functions related to course organization
- Serving as subject coordinator, balancing academic integrity with student needs

<!--
With a dedication to fostering a deep understanding of economics and its real-world applications, I strive to create a motivating, supportive learning environment for all students. Through my diverse teaching experiences and commitment to student success, I aim to prepare students for informed decision-making that will shape their futures and positively impact their communities.

I believe in teaching economics as a foundation for critical thinking, where models serve as tools to structure thought and spark inquiry, highlighting channels for empirical exploration, rather than as objects of reverence. My approach emphasizes clear explanations, structured learning, and spontaneous discussions. I also offer strong support to struggling students, understanding firsthand the transformative impact of an inspiring teacher. My goal is to instill a genuine motivation for economics, emphasizing the essential complement between theory and evidence in meaningful investigation. I recognize that many, if not all, students will one day make important decisions impacting their families, communities, nations, or even the world, and I am committed to equipping them with the tools to make informed, thoughtful choices.

 Inspired by the adage “*the road to hell is paved with good intentions*,” I am interested in how welfare policies impact economic outcomes and intended beneficiaries. By modeling behavioral responses and the tax burdens needed to finance these policies, my research explores their aggregate, distributional, and behavioral impacts through micro-founded macroeconomic models. With a blend of single and collaborative empirical and quantitative projects, I aim to contribute meaningful insights to pressing economic questions. In addition to my research, I bring extensive teaching experience with high performance ratings since 2018.

  By modeling behavioral responses in a general equilibrium framework with rich household heterogeneity, my research explores the aggregate and distributional impacts of tax and transfer policies, focusing especially on their unintended consequences on the intended beneficiaries. With a blend of single and collaborative empirical and quantitative projects, my work contributes to the understanding of optimal policy design. I am also interested in extending this framework to study policy design in developing countries and to explore broader economic phenomena beyond policy analysis. 
  
  In addition to my research, I have extensive teaching experience, consistently achieving high performance ratings since 2018 (average over 4.5/5).
