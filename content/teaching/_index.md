# Teaching 

## Philosophy
I believe in teaching economics as a foundation for critical thinking, where models serve as tools to structure thought and spark inquiry, highlighting channels for empirical exploration, rather than as objects of reverence. I offer strong support to struggling students, understanding firsthand the transformative impact of an inspiring teacher. My goal is to instill a genuine motivation for economics, emphasizing the essential complement between theory and evidence in meaningful investigation.

## Other Responsibilities

My teaching experience extends beyond the classroom, encompassing full course coordination and effective team management. In my roles as Associate Lecturer and Head Teaching Assistant, I organized course structures, coordinated and supported tutors, and liaised between the teaching team and students to ensure a smooth learning experience. I also handled sensitive academic cases that required balancing academic integrity, ethical standards, and empathy toward students’ unique situations—a role that often felt like walking on eggshells. Through these experiences, I have developed strong interpersonal skills and a commitment to creating a positive learning environment.

My responsibilities in various roles have included:

- Preparation and delivery of tutorials, lectures, workshops, and seminars
- Coordination and support of sessional tutors
- Involvement in professional activities related to the teaching field
- Student consultations
- Assessment and grading
- Development of course materials in collaboration with course coordinators
- Administrative functions related to course organization
- Serving as subject coordinator, balancing academic integrity with student needs


<!--
With a dedication to fostering a deep understanding of economics and its real-world applications, I strive to create a motivating, supportive learning environment for all students. Through my diverse teaching experiences and commitment to student success, I aim to prepare students for informed decision-making that will shape their futures and positively impact their communities.

I believe in teaching economics as a foundation for critical thinking, where models serve as tools to structure thought and spark inquiry, highlighting channels for empirical exploration, rather than as objects of reverence. My approach emphasizes clear explanations, structured learning, and spontaneous discussions. I also offer strong support to struggling students, understanding firsthand the transformative impact of an inspiring teacher. My goal is to instill a genuine motivation for economics, emphasizing the essential complement between theory and evidence in meaningful investigation. I recognize that many, if not all, students will one day make important decisions impacting their families, communities, nations, or even the world, and I am committed to equipping them with the tools to make informed, thoughtful choices.
