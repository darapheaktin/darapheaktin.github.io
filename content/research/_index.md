## On the Joint Optimal Design of Taxes and Child Benefits

**Author**: Darapheak Tin
<!--
<div style="font-size:16px;">
Means-tested child benefits and progressive tax systems both aim to support low-income families, but often create high and non-linear effective marginal tax rate schedules. This paper explores the joint optimization of these systems within a dynamic general equilibrium model of overlapping generations, calibrated to Australia (2012-2018). The model incorporates household heterogeneity in family structure, age and number of children, female human capital, and uninsurable earnings risks. I find that a standalone optimal tax system would reduce tax progressivity, encouraging labor supply among highly educated women but increasing tax liabilities on low-income parents, thus undermining the objectives of child benefit programs. A jointly optimized system combines low tax progressivity and a universal lump-sum child benefit equal to 30% of median income (around AUD 18,000 in 2018), partly to offset the additional tax burdens on low-income parents. This integrated approach substantially improves overall and parental welfare, but non-parent households bear notable losses. A moderately reduced benefit, while not optimal, achieves welfare gains for parents with lower costs to non-parents. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating tax and child benefit policies to effectively support vulnerable parents, while cautioning against equity losses for non-parents when policies are optimized solely for overall welfare.

While means-tested child benefit and progressive tax systems aim to support low-income families, my empirical analysis based on Australian household survey data (HILDA) reveals that their interaction creates high, non-linear effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) for low-income mothers. Building on these findings, this paper examines the joint optimal design of tax and child benefit systems using a dynamic general equilibrium model of overlapping generations, calibrated to Australia (2012-2018). The model incorporates rich household heterogeneity in family structure, age and number of children, female human capital, and uninsurable earnings risks. I find that an optimal tax reform, focused solely on income tax, requires reducing tax progressivity, which encourages labor supply primarily among highly educated women. However, it also raises tax liabilities for low-income parents, thereby undermining the objectives of child benefit programs.

A joint optimal system combines reduced tax progressivity with a universal lump-sum child benefit set at approximately 30% of median income. While the more proportional tax scheme benefits high-education parents, the transfer—free from means-testing and double the average baseline payment—compensates low-income parent households for the increased tax liabilities. This approach significantly improves parental and overall welfare but shifts more of the tax burden onto non-parent households, causing them to experience notable losses. A moderately scaled-back benefit, though not optimal, yields welfare gains for parents at a lower cost to non-parents. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating tax and child benefit policies to effectively support vulnerable parents while cautioning against equity losses for non-parents when policies are optimized solely for overall welfare.

        Progressive income tax and means-tested child benefit systems are designed to support low-income families; however, their interaction generates high and non-linear effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), which create substantial work disincentives for recipients, especially low-income mothers. I document this equity-efficiency trade-off using Australian household survey data (HILDA), explore how tax and child benefit systems should be designed to maximize (ex-ante) welfare, and examine their macroeconomic and distributional implications. To this end, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of overlapping generations, calibrated to Australia (2012–2018), featuring rich household heterogeneity in family structure, female human capital, uninsurable earnings risks, and the age and number of children. I find that optimal tax reform entails reducing tax progressivity, shifting tax burdens from high- to low-income brackets to incentivize longer work hours. This scheme produces a modest welfare gain but disadvantages some low-education parents, thereby undermining the objectives of child benefit programs.
        <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
            I demonstrate that a joint optimal system—combining reduced tax progressivity with a universal lump-sum child benefit at 30% of average income—yields superior overall and parental welfare outcomes. While reduced tax progressivity benefits high-education parents, the joint design allows for transfers to compensate low-education parents for the increased tax liabilities. However, the high tax burden required to fund the expanded child benefit program imposes notable welfare losses on non-parents. Moderately scaled-back transfers provide smaller welfare gains but at substantially lower costs to non-parents, whereas overly generous transfers lead to excessive tax burdens, contracting the economy and harming the intended beneficiaries. These findings highlight the importance of policy coordination and fiscal sustainability in effectively supporting vulnerable parents while balancing equity and efficiency considerations.

## The Evolution of Earnings Distribution in a Sustained Growth Economy: Evidence from Australia

**Authors**: Darapheak Tin, Chung Tran, and Nabeeh Zakariyya  
**Status**: Ongoing

<div style="font-size:16px;">
Abstract We study the evolution of the earnings distributions in Australia from 1991 to 2020, a prolonged period of sustained economic growth without recession. Using a 10% sample of Australian taxpayer records, we document key trends in labour earnings inequality, mobility and risk for workers aged 25 to 55. Our findings reveal strong upward earnings mobility for both men and women. Earnings inequality rose modestly until the early 2010s, driven by top earners, but has since declined. The gender gap in earnings inequality has narrowed, and even reversed in recent years, mainly due to a sharp reduction in inequality among women at the lower end of the earnings distribution. Early-life disparities also play an increasingly important role in shaping later-life inequality, particularly for younger cohorts. This reversal in inequality trends has emerged over the past decade, coinciding with a slowdown in economic growth. Moreover, although aggregate macroeconomic conditions have been relatively stable, idiosyncratic earnings risk—captured by dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis—remains persistent, with greater volatility at both the top and bottom percentiles. Women continue to face higher risk and lower mobility than men, despite experiencing stronger average earnings growth over the entire period. Hence, our findings provide new insights into how prolonged economic expansion shapes the dynamics of earnings across different demographic and income groups.

## Child-Related Transfers, Means Testing, and Welfare

**Authors**: Darapheak Tin and Chung Tran  
**Status**: Ongoing
<!--
<div style="font-size:16px;">
Should government transfers to families with children be means-tested? We revisit this question from the unique Australian policy context, where average means-tested child benefits comprise up to 40% of the gross total income of low-income households, coinciding with the distinct M-shaped life cycle profile of labor supply for Australian mothers (Household survey data, HILDA 2001-2020). Motivated by these empirical facts, we explore the aggregate and distributive implications of means-testing and alternative child benefit designs quantitatively through a dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations model of single and married households with children. Our simulation results demonstrate the significant adverse effects of means-testing on work incentives and human capital development among mothers. A structural reform that replaces the status quo means-tested system with a universal system improves female labor supply, output, and overall welfare while also garnering majority support. However, the universal system increases tax burden by 4 percentage points and negatively impacts single mothers—the intended beneficiaries—by reducing their net lifetime income and welfare. In our model, the inclusion of means-testing is essential for controlling fiscal costs and mitigating the adverse effects of higher taxes. Preserving the existing means-tested system and opting for incremental reforms could potentially result in modest improvements in output and welfare while ensuring a more equitable distribution of welfare gains. Hence, our findings highlight the complex trade-offs between efficiency and equity in designing child benefit programs.

This paper examines the evolution of earnings distribution over three decades of uninterrupted economic growth in Australia (1991-2020). Using a 10% sample of taxpayer records, we find moderate upward mobility and a narrowing gender earnings gap. However, earnings inequality has increased, primarily driven by growth at the top of the income distribution, with men experiencing higher levels of inequality than women. Our results further indicate that inequality is increasingly shaped by initial labor market entry conditions, reflecting a shift toward more persistent early-life disparities. Additionally, idiosyncratic earnings risk—measured through dispersion, skewness, and kurtosis of earnings shocks—remained persistent throughout this period. Women continue to face greater earnings risk and lower mobility than men, despite exhibiting stronger and more consistent earnings growth. These findings provide new insights into the implications of sustained economic growth for earnings inequality, mobility, and risk across different population segments in the absence of major economic recessions.

## ["Lifecycle Earnings Risk and Insurance: New Evidence from Australia"](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-4932.12723)

<div style="font-size:16px;">
  This paper studies the nature of earnings dynamics in Australia, using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey 2001–2020. Our results indicate that the distribution of earnings shocks displays negative skewness and excess kurtosis, deviating from the conventional linearity and normality assumptions. Wage changes are strongly associated with earnings changes and account more for the dispersion of earnings shocks; meanwhile, the contribution of hour changes is largely absent in upward movement and relatively small in downward movement of earnings changes. Furthermore, family and government insurance plays distinct roles in reducing exposure to earnings risk. Government insurance embedded in the targeted transfer system is important in mitigating the dispersion of shocks, whereas family insurance via income pooling and adjustment of secondary earners' labour market activities is dominant in reducing the magnitude and likelihood of extreme and rare shocks. The magnitude and persistence of earnings risk as well as the insurance role of family and government vary significantly across gender, marital, and parental status. Accounting for these non-Gaussian and non-linearity features is important for evaluating the insurance role of government transfer programmes.

Means-tested child benefits and progressive tax systems both aim to support low-income families, but they often create high and non-linear effective marginal tax rate schedules. This paper explores the joint design of these systems in a dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations that captures household heterogeneity in family structure, education, female human capital formation, child-related costs, and uninsurable earnings and longevity risks. The model is calibrated to the Australian economy (2012-2018), where means-tested lump sum child benefits constitute up to 40% of income for low-income households. I find that optimizing the tax system in isolation risks undermining the redistributive goals of child benefit programs. A joint design featuring low tax progressivity and a universal lump-sum child benefit of approximately 30% of median income (around AUD 18,000 in 2018) is optimal, significantly improving consumption allocative efficiency and overall welfare. However, the associated tax burden adversely impacts non-parent households, raising equity concerns. A less generous benefit, while not fully optimal, still provides welfare gains for parents and imposes considerably lower costs on non-parents. Conversely, overly generous child benefits lead to fiscal pressures that harm all households, including the intended beneficiaries. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating tax and child benefit policies to effectively support vulnerable parents, especially low-education single mothers.
