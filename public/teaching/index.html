<h2 id="teaching-experience">Teaching Experience</h2>
<p>I have extensive teaching experience across a broad range of undergraduate and graduate courses in the College of Business and Economics (CBE) and the College of Arts and Social Sciences (CASS) at the Australian National University (ANU). Starting as a Teaching Assistant in 2018, I was appointed as an Associate Lecturer at the Research School of Economics in 2022-2023. Currently, I serve as a Head Teaching Assistant. Throughout my teaching career, I have consistently received high student evaluations, with SELT scores exceeding 4.5/5.</p>
<p>My teaching experience extends beyond the classroom, encompassing full course coordination and effective team management. In my roles as Associate Lecturer and Head Teaching Assistant, I organized course structures, coordinated and supported tutors, and liaised between the teaching team and students to ensure a smooth learning experience. I also handled sensitive academic cases that required balancing academic integrity, ethical standards, and empathy toward students’ unique situations—a role that often felt like walking on eggshells. Through these experiences, I have developed strong interpersonal skills and a commitment to creating a positive learning environment.</p>
